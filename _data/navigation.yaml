# This file is used to define the site menu.
# It is a YAML file, where the top-level structure is an array.
#

- title: "Home"
  url: "/index.html"

  
  # Self Explanatory
- title: "Sub-Menu"
  id: submenu
  folderitems:
    - title: "About"
      url: "/about"
    - title: "Custom"
      url: "/custom-pages/"
    - title: "item2"
      url: "/fake"
    - title: "item3"
      url: "/fake"

- title: "No Sub-Menu"
  url: "/fake"
      


# You are limited to eight menu items.  If you need more, use dropdowns.
#
# Each array item needs a "title" key, which is what gets displayed on-screen.
# Each array item also needs EITHER a "url" key OR a "dropdown" key.
#
# * If the "url" key is used, then this menu item is a path to another page.
#
#   The path you provide must be relative to the site root.  Jekyll will
#   automatically fill in the appropriate prefix during HTML generation.
#
#   If the "url" is set to an empty string, that will be replaced with
#   the path to the site's home page.
#
# * If the "dropdown" key is used, then this menu item is a dropdown.
# 
#   With a dropdown, you have another YAML array, of "title" and "url" pairs.
#   In this case, BOTH "title" and "url" are required.
#   Nested dropdowns (that is, dropdowns in dropdowns) are not supported.
